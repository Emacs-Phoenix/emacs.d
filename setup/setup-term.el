;;Those who are accustomed to use M-x shell may find M-x ansi-term does not adhere explicit-bash-args (e.g. to make the login-shell), nor .emacs_bash (or .emacs.d/init_bash.sh). Since M-x ansi-term does not support additional arguments to the shell, I’d write small replacement to M-x ansi-term to mimic M-x shell.
